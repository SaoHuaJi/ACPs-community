ADP: Agent Discovery Protocol (ACPs-spec-ADP-v02.02)

# 1. Document Definition

This document is the standard definition of the Agent Discovery Protocol (ADP) within the ACPs agent collaboration protocol system, version v02.02.

The full title of the document is ACPs-spec-ADP-v02.02.

# 2. Introduction to the Agent Discovery Process

For agent interconnection to become a secure and reliable agent system, a standardized and flexible agent discovery process is required in order to achieve collaboration between agents. This document defines the Agent Discovery Protocol (ADP), which follows the principles below and achieves the corresponding objectives:

(1) Meet the collaboration requirements of heterogeneous agents: a service-requesting agent can quickly discover agents that satisfy its capability requirements through the ADP mechanism;

(2) Support autonomous collaboration in dynamic environments: the ADP mechanism should be able to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of agent interconnection caused by the joining, leaving, or changing of agents, ensuring that the service-requesting agent can obtain agents that satisfy its capability requirements;

# 3. Role Definitions and Interaction Process in the Agent Discovery Process

The roles and the interaction process involved in the agent discovery process are shown in the figure below.
![6-1.png](6-1.png)

The agent discovery process involves the following roles:

● Requesting agent: the requesting agent is the party that initiates a service request when, according to its task objectives, it needs other agents to provide services for collaboration.

● Discovery server: a service node provided by an agent discovery service provider, whose function is to receive agent discovery requests and return matching retrieval results. The requesting agent may obtain the address of the discovery server through local configuration or through a service discovery mechanism in its environment.

● Registration server: a service node provided by an agent registration service provider, whose function is to expose agent registration information externally. The discovery server may synchronize agent description information through the *DSP: Data Synchronization Protocol*.

● Serving agent: a serving agent created and managed by an agent provider.

The agent discovery process includes the following steps:

(1) The requesting agent reasons about the task;

(2) The requesting agent decomposes the tasks that need to be carried out in collaboration with other agents, sends an agent discovery request to the discovery server, and carries the task information that requires collaboration;

(3) The discovery server performs matching retrieval based on the locally maintained agent directory; the directory may consist of registration information and related status information, and its synchronization mechanism may refer to the *DSP: Data Synchronization Protocol*;

(4) The discovery server matches the task information requiring collaboration in the request against the stored agent description information;

(5) The discovery server returns the agent or agent list information that meets the requirements to the requesting agent;

(6) According to its own policy, the requesting agent selects the agent to collaborate with (the serving agent) from the list and performs identity verification with it;

(7) After identity verification succeeds, the requesting agent establishes a connection with the serving agent and collaborates to complete the task.

# 4. Agent Discovery API

Through this API, the requesting agent interacts with the discovery server in order to discover serving agents that satisfy its task requirements.

## 4.1. API Specification

### 4.1.1. Discovery Request API Specification

- **Interface description**: for a requesting agent to discover serving agents that satisfy specific capability requirements.
- **Authentication method**: `mTLS`. The requesting agent must provide a valid certificate.
- **Request method**: `POST`
- **Request URL**: `{ADP_BASE_URL}/discover`
- **Request body**: `DiscoveryRequest`
- **Response body**: `DiscoveryResponse`
- **Response codes**:
  - 200 OK: the request succeeded.
  - 307 Temporary Redirect: redirect to a target discovery server that is valid only for this request. A `Location` response header indicates the new address. `error.code` in the response body indicates the reason for the redirect.
  - 400 Bad Request: invalid request parameters.
  - 401 Unauthorized: invalid certificate.
  - 429 Too Many Requests: the call rate exceeds the limit; a `Retry-After` response header indicates the retry time.
  - 508 Loop Detected: a forwarding loop was detected, the forwarding depth limit was exceeded, or the forwarding budget is insufficient.
  - 500 Internal Server Error: server-side exception.
- **Regarding ordering**:
  - The list of candidate serving agents in the response result should be sorted by match score from highest to lowest.
  - The sorting algorithm is determined by the discovery server implementation, but the order in the response should be directly usable for candidate selection.
- **Semantics of 307 Temporary Redirect**:
  - When a discovery server cannot complete the current query due to resource, policy, or geographic coverage limitations, it may return 307 and include a `Location` header in the response pointing to a recommended target discovery server;
  - The redirect takes effect only for the current request; the client must not cache this address, nor use it by default in subsequent requests;
  - After receiving 307, the client should re-issue the query once to the new address, carrying the original request body and mTLS credentials;
  - If multiple 307 responses are received in succession, the client may decide, according to its own policy, whether to continue redirecting or to report a failure; it is recommended that the maximum number of hops not exceed 5.

### 4.1.2. Error Code Definitions

Definitions of the error codes (`error.code`) in the response body:

| Error code | Meaning                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 30702  | RegionRedirect            | Because of geographic or compliance policy, the query is not covered; it returns 307 to direct to a discovery server in a covered region.                                                                      |

| 40003  | ForwardChainInvalid       | The `forwardChain` carried by the client contains an invalid AIC.                                                                                                                                              |
| 40004  | FilterInvalid             | A condition in `filter` is invalid, or the conditions contradict each other.                                                                                                                                   |

### 4.1.3. Common Semantics for Collaboration Among Multiple Discovery Servers

ADP allows multiple discovery servers to collaborate in order to cover a broader capability directory and improve availability. The externally visible collaboration modes include:

- **Redirect**: the current node does not participate in the query and instead directs the requester to access another discovery server directly;
- **Forwarding**: the current node continues the query with other discovery servers on behalf of the requester and transparently passes through the results;
- **Fan-out + Aggregation**: the current node queries multiple discovery servers concurrently and aggregates the returned candidates.

The semantics of the common fields are as follows:

- `forwardChain`: records the chain of AICs that the request passes through between discovery servers. The original request usually does not carry this field; it is maintained hop by hop by the discovery servers on the forwarding path.
- `requestId`: the globally unique identifier of this original discovery request. The original request usually does not carry this field; it is generated by the first-hop discovery server that receives the initial request and remains unchanged during forwarding, and is used for cross-branch correlation, log tracing, and result aggregation.
- `forwardDepthLimit`: the maximum forwarding depth allowed for a single chain. The server default value may be 3, and the absolute upper limit is 5.
- `forwardFanoutLimit`: the maximum number of concurrent downstream requests allowed. The server default value may be 1, and the absolute upper limit is 5. When it is not provided, the discovery server must not actively initiate multi-way concurrent forwarding.
- `forwardFanoutRemaining`: the fan-out budget still consumable by the current branch. This value is maintained by the discovery server during forwarding.
- `forwardTrustedServers`: the list of trusted discovery server AICs provided by the entry discovery server, used to constrain subsequent forwarding targets.
- `forwardSignatures`: the list of signatures appended by the discovery servers on the forwarding path, used to protect chain integrity.
- `acsMap`: the globally unique ACS data repository, containing at least the ACS data of all AICs in `agents`.
- `agents`: the list of discovered candidate agents, which is the main result consumed by the client.
- `routes`: optional; returns the skill information on each chained or aggregated path one by one, mainly used for debugging and attribution.

The specific implementations of route selection, caching, indexing, deduplication, and sorting are determined by the discovery server, but their behavior must conform to the data structures and response semantics defined in this specification.

### 4.1.4. Batch, Retry, and Cache

- **Batch discovery requests are not supported**: a requesting agent may implement batch discovery requirements by sending multiple discovery requests concurrently. This document does not define a batch interface that contains multiple queries in a single request.
- **Recommended retry policy**:
  - For 4xx errors, the parameters must be corrected before re-issuing the request; in the case of a 429 error, the waiting time indicated by `Retry-After` should be respected before retrying;
  - For 5xx or network errors, exponential backoff retry is recommended.
- **Cache recommendations**:
  - A requesting agent may cache discovery results according to its own policy, in order to reduce repeated queries and lower latency;
  - A discovery server may use standard HTTP cache control fields (such as `Cache-Control`, `ETag`) in response headers to indicate the caching policy for the response.

## 4.2. Data Structures

   * Query type.
   * - explicit: explicit query (default value); the content of `query` has a clear intent, and is filtered according to `filter`.
   * - exploratory: exploratory query; the user has no clear goal and hopes the system will "give something interesting". `query` may be empty, or its content may be fairly broad.
   * - trending: trending query; the system is expected to return currently popular agents. `query` may be empty, or its content may be fairly broad.
   * - filtered: filtered query; filtering is performed only according to `filter`, `query` should be empty, and it will be ignored if it is not empty.

### 4.2.2. ACS Filtering Description

`DiscoveryFilter` adopts the generic "condition array + logical combination" pattern (drawing on the operator naming of MongoDB Query / SCIM 2.0), and has the following design advantages:

- **JSON-native**: it is embedded directly in the request body, with no string parsing required.
- **Unified mechanism**: one `{ field, op, value }` structure covers all ACS field types, and adding or removing fields does not change the protocol structure.
- **Logical combination**: arbitrary depths of AND/OR/NOT are supported through nested `groups` + `logic`.
- **Forwarding pass-through**: an intermediate discovery server can forward the filter conditions directly, without needing to understand the semantics of every field.

After receiving filter conditions, the discovery server should validate the validity of field paths, the compatibility between operators and field types, and whether the nesting depth exceeds the limit (it is recommended not to exceed 3 levels). Invalid conditions should return error code 40004 (FilterInvalid).

> Note ¹: for strings, gt/gte/lt/lte compare in lexicographic order, mainly used in scenarios such as version number comparison.
>
> Note ²: operators applicable to strings (eq, ne, in, nin, contains, notContains, startsWith, endsWith) match in a **case-insensitive** manner by default. If case-sensitive matching is required, use the corresponding `Cs` suffix variant (such as `eqCs`, `containsCs`). The Cs variants apply only to the string type.

#### Filtering Examples

**Example 1: simple conditions (AND logic)**

Query agents that are active, whose protocol version is 02.02, that support JSONRPC, and that have streaming responses:

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    { "field": "active", "op": "eq", "value": true },
    { "field": "protocolVersion", "op": "in", "value": ["02.02"] },
    { "field": "endPoints.transport", "op": "in", "value": ["JSONRPC"] },
    { "field": "capabilities.streaming", "op": "eq", "value": true },
    { "field": "skills.tags", "op": "anyOf", "value": ["data processing", "Beijing"] }
  ]
}
```

**Example 2: date range + version comparison**

Query agents updated within 2025 whose version is ≥ 2.0.0:

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "field": "lastModifiedTime",
      "op": "between",
      "value": ["2025-01-01T00:00:00+08:00", "2025-12-31T23:59:59+08:00"]
    },
    { "field": "version", "op": "gte", "value": "2.0.0" }
  ]
}
```

**Example 3: OR logic - cross-field combination**

Query agents for which (streaming=true and the organization contains "university") or (OIDC authentication is present and MQTT is supported):

```json
{
  "logic": "or",
  "groups": [
    {
      "conditions": [
        { "field": "capabilities.streaming", "op": "eq", "value": true },
        { "field": "provider.organization", "op": "contains", "value": "university" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "conditions": [
        { "field": "securitySchemes", "op": "hasKey", "value": "oidc" },
        {
          "field": "capabilities.messageQueue",
          "op": "anyOf",
          "value": ["mqtt:5.0"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example 4: NOT logic - excluding specific organizations**

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    { "field": "active", "op": "eq", "value": true },
    { "field": "provider.organization", "op": "nin", "value": ["a blocklisted organization"] }
  ]
}
```

**Example 5: existence and array length checks**

Query agents that have service endpoints, have a web application URL, and have at least 3 skills:

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    { "field": "endPoints", "op": "exists", "value": true },
    { "field": "webAppUrl", "op": "exists", "value": true },
    { "field": "skills", "op": "sizeGte", "value": 3 }
  ]
}
```

**Example 6: AIC prefix matching**

```json
{
  "conditions": [{ "field": "aic", "op": "startsWith", "value": "1000100001" }]
}
```

### 4.2.3. Other Notes

The fields of `DiscoveryContext` are advisory only; the caller and the discovery server may extend them with more key-value pairs according to the scenario, and should agree on a security policy and a maximum payload, so as to ensure secure transmission within the server-side risk control limits.

`agents` and `acsMap` are the main fields consumed by the client. `acsMap` is located at the top level of `DiscoveryResult` and is the globally unique ACS data repository; it contains at least the ACS data of all AICs in `agents`. The discovery server may include, as needed, the additional AICs appearing in `routes`, but this is not mandatory. The client should not assume that an AIC referenced in `routes` can necessarily be found in `acsMap`.

During aggregated forwarding, the discovery server needs to maintain an independent `DiscoveryRoute` for each downstream request, and to return the deduplicated and sorted aggregated result in `agents`. `routes` is an optional field, mainly used for debugging and attribution; if a certain route fails, the specific reason may be reflected through the `status` field, making it easier for the requesting agent to perform fault-tolerant handling.

`agents` and `DiscoveryAgentGroup` in `DiscoveryRoute.agentGroups` should contain at least one group. If the business does not require grouping (such as a simple single-intent query), an array containing a single default group should still be returned, and `group` may be set to the original query text or an empty string, so as to keep the response structure uniform.

`aliveMap` is optional additional liveness status information, populated in batches by the discovery server from the locally maintained AMP alive replica, keyed by AIC. The lookup method is the same as for `acsMap`, using `DiscoveryAgentSkill.aic` as the key. When consuming it, the client should observe the following rules:

- **Field absent**: the discovery server has not enabled AMP alive synchronization, and the client must not judge the liveness status of an agent on this basis.
- **Key absent** (`aliveMap` exists but does not contain a certain AIC): the liveness status of that AIC is currently unknown (alive sync has not yet covered it), which is not equivalent to being inactive.
- **`alive=false`**: the monitoring server has confirmed that the AIC is currently inactive (for example, its heartbeat timed out), and the client may lower its priority or skip that AIC on this basis.
- **`aliveLastSeenAt`**: for display reference only; it is not guaranteed to be strictly consistent with the current state of the monitoring server, and must not be used for precise freshness judgments.
- **Forwarding scenario**: `aliveMap` reflects the local alive replica of the **discovery server that is the source of the results**, and is therefore populated only by the source server that produced that batch of results. An intermediate (forwarding/aggregating) discovery server should **pass through** the `aliveMap` returned by downstream **as is**, and **must not** use its own local replica to **overwrite or merge** the downstream entries (the source node has greater authority over the liveness status of its own agents, and cross-node merging would introduce inconsistency and misleading information). In other words: the `aliveMap` entry for each AIC comes from at most one source — the discovery server that produced it.

## 4.3. Example Requests and Responses

### 4.3.6. Response Carrying aliveMap (AMP alive Synchronization Enabled)

When the discovery server has enabled the AMP Heartbeat alive synchronization function, the response carries an additional `aliveMap` field, on the basis of which the client can perceive the liveness status of candidate agents. In this example, `AIC-NLP-AGENT-003` is currently marked as inactive by the monitoring system, and the client may lower its priority when selecting.

**Example request**

```http
POST /discover HTTP/1.1
Host: ds-a.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
X-Trace-Id: trace-20251125-qrst7890
X-Span-Id: span-client-005

{
  "type": "explicit",
  "query": "I need a natural language processing agent"
}
```

**Example response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Trace-Id: trace-20251125-qrst7890
X-Span-Id: span-ds-a-005

{
  "result": {
    "acsMap": {
      "AIC-NLP-AGENT-001": {
        "aic": "AIC-NLP-AGENT-001",
        "name": "NLP Agent Alpha",
        "skills": [{ "id": "nlp-001", "name": "Text classification", "tags": ["NLP", "classification"] }]
      },
      "AIC-NLP-AGENT-003": {
        "aic": "AIC-NLP-AGENT-003",
        "name": "NLP Agent Gamma",
        "skills": [{ "id": "nlp-003", "name": "Named entity recognition", "tags": ["NLP", "NER"] }]
      }
    },
    "agents": [
      {
        "group": "Natural language processing",
        "skills": [
          { "aic": "AIC-NLP-AGENT-001", "skillId": "nlp-001", "score": 0.95 },
          { "aic": "AIC-NLP-AGENT-003", "skillId": "nlp-003", "score": 0.82 }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "aliveMap": {
      "AIC-NLP-AGENT-001": {
        "alive": true,
        "aliveLastSeenAt": "2025-11-25T03:41:00Z"
      },
      "AIC-NLP-AGENT-003": {
        "alive": false,
        "aliveLastSeenAt": "2025-11-25T01:12:33Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Client consumption note**: the keys of `aliveMap` correspond to the keys of `acsMap`. In this example, `AIC-NLP-AGENT-003` has `alive=false`,
> so the client may preferentially select `AIC-NLP-AGENT-001`, or display an "offline" marker for `AIC-NLP-AGENT-003` in the UI.
> When the `aliveMap` field is absent, the client should treat the liveness status as "unknown", and must not treat the absence as meaning that all are offline.

# 5. Supplementary Notes

The agent discovery process defined in this document fully takes manageability and compatibility into account, and is provided free of charge to the relevant researchers, developers, and institutions for reference. We welcome colleagues in the industry who are engaged in agent research and development and in the formulation of agent interconnection protocols to support and adopt this process definition, so as to form an agent discovery mechanism that is conducive to interconnection and interoperability and to good compatibility.
